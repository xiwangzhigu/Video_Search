Building html5media
===================

If you can see this file, then you've created a clone of the html5media GitHub
repository or have downloaded one of the source tarballs. This is perfect if you
want to help develop html5media.

If you simply want to use html5media in your site, it's recommended that you
simply link to the html5media CDN script, as explained on the [html5media project site].

Running the build script
------------------------

To run the build script you'll need a copy of [nodejs] and [gulp] installed on your
system. Assuming you have this, building html5media is simply a case of opening
a terminal and running the build script in the root of the project directory like so:

    $ gulp build
    
The built html5media code will all be placed in a brand-new `build/` directory
in the root of the project.

**Happy coding!**
